    "### Business Case Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You're working as a data scientist for a contracting firm that's rapidly expanding. Now that they have their most valuable employee (you!), they need to leverage data to win more contracts. Your firm offers technology and scientific solutions and wants to be competitive in the hiring market. Your principal wants you to\n",
    "\n",
    "   - determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts for these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit the scope, your principal has suggested that you *focus on data-related job postings*, e.g. data scientist, data analyst, research scientist, business intelligence, and any others you might think of. You may also want to decrease the scope by *limiting your search to a single region.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Aggregators like [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com) regularly pool job postings from a variety of markets and industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Scrape your own data from a job aggregation tool like Indeed.com in order to collect the data to best answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will be leveraging a variety of skills. The first will be to use the web-scraping and/or API techniques you've learned to collect data on data jobs from Indeed.com or another aggregator. Once you have collected and cleaned the data, you will use it to address the question above."

    "### Factors that impact salary\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict salary the most appropriate approach would be a regression model.\n",
    "Here instead we just want to estimate which factors (like location, job title, job level, industry sector) lead to high or low salary and work with a classification model. To do so, split the salary into two groups of high and low salary, for example by choosing the median salary as a threshold (in principle you could choose any single or multiple splitting points).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use all the skills you have learned so far to build a predictive model.\n",
    "Whatever you decide to use, the most important thing is to justify your choices and interpret your results. *Communication of your process is key.* Note that most listings **DO NOT** come with salary information. You'll need to be able to extrapolate or predict the expected salaries for these listings."
