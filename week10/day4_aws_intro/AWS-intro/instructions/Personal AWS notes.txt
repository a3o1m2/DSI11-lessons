Personal AWS notes:

1. EC2 is an instance of cloud space you've rented, you would generally not have relevant packages installed on this computer
2. S3 simple storage service... bucket space for large files, you would normally have your python notebook write any outputs or read any inputs from this location.
3. You can get conda install or pip install within a copy of your jupyter notebook, and also need to export any large files over to the cloud or to a bucket.
4. Then copy over the jupyter notebook to the server.
5. Then get the public ip address and run a https://[insert ip address] to then log into jupyter notebook on that server, and then you can run your notebook as you wish.
6. You may have to ensure that any read / write is pointed to a bucket if you have large files (look in boto3 file in this folder for instructions how to connect notebook to bucket files)
