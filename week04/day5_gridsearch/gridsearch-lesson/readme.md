# Introduction to Gridsearching Hyperparameters


---

### Core

- Understand what the terms gridsearch and hyperparameter refer to.
- Understand how to manually build a gridsearching procedure.
- Apply sklearn's `GridSearchCV` object with basketball data to optimize a KNN model.
- Interpret the output from gridsearch

### Target

- Practice the gridsearch procedure independently optimizing regularized logistic regression.
- Understand the pitfalls of searching large hyperparameter spaces.
- Understand how to set up parameter dictionaries for gridsearch


### Stretch
- Look at the documentation for GridSearchCV on sklearn's website, and investigate the different options that are available (for example, the attribute `.cv_results_`)
